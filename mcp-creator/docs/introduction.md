# Introduction to MCP Creator

## What is MCP Creator?

MCP Creator is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of creating Model Context Protocol (MCP) server projects. It provides an interactive experience to configure and generate a new MCP server with various features based on user preferences.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for building and interacting with AI services. It defines a common interface for AI models, tools, and resources, enabling interoperability between different AI systems. MCP servers act as the backbone for these AI services, providing a consistent way to expose AI capabilities through a well-defined API.

## Why Use MCP Creator?

Creating an MCP server from scratch can be time-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the protocol specifications. MCP Creator simplifies this process by:

1. **Providing a guided setup experience**: Interactive prompts help you configure your MCP server without needing to understand all the underlying details.

2. **Generating boilerplate code**: MCP Creator generates all the necessary files and directory structure for your MCP server, saving you time and effort.

3. **Offering customization options**: Choose from different complexity levels and feature sets to tailor your MCP server to your specific needs.

4. **Ensuring best practices**: The generated code follows best practices for MCP server development, helping you create robust and maintainable services.

5. **Simplifying dependency management**: MCP Creator automatically installs all required dependencies, so you can focus on building your AI services.

## Key Concepts

### MCP Server

An MCP server is a web service that implements the Model Context Protocol, allowing clients to interact with AI models, tools, and resources through a standardized API.

### Handlers

Handlers are functions that process specific types of requests in an MCP server. They define the behavior of your AI services and are the primary way to extend your MCP server's functionality.

### Tools

Tools are functions that can be called by AI models to perform specific tasks, such as retrieving information, processing data, or interacting with external systems.

### Resources

Resources are data objects that can be accessed by AI models, providing context or information needed for processing requests.
